# Frontend

This guide will help you set up and run the frontend application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

```sh
cd ./frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

By default, the application runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

This will generate an optimized production-ready build and start the server.

## Next Steps

Now that your frontend is up and running, you can proceed with further development and customization.
